            PYTHON:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">
            My journey started with PHP but I fell out of love with it due to its unstructured nature. My search
            for structure led me to the arms of Python and it's been awesome ever since. Fast prototyping, Artificial 
            Intelligence/Machine Learning, Server Management and basic scripting. It can do it all, and that's why I love it.
        </p>

            DJANGO/DJANGO-REST-FRAMEWORK/GRAPHQL:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">            
            I love creating for the web. These tools make it super-fun for me to create web services and projects that expose
            high level models and pipelines to the world. Django has all the bells and whistles I need in building fast MVPs
            and that's why I love it.

            DOCKER:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">            
            Docker is a composer for me. It takes a chunk of tiome to get all the parts of an application working together - app servers,
            databases, cache systems, static backends and more. Docker helps me bring all these distinct technology into one inter-relating pie
            of awesomeness.

        <h2 class="my-3 tracking-tight leading-tight font-semibold text-sm">
            LINUX/UBUNTU:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">            
            No trying to throw shades at Windows here but writing software on a Linux distro makes life way easier for me. I use Linux for two reasons
            (a) It gives me control over my tools. When using Linux, I am not just a user connecting with a computer via an interface, I am one with the computer,
            no middle-men (or middlewares) to abstract the power of raw bash (b) It's open source, and highly maintenable.

            AWS/DIGITAL-OCEAN/HEROKU/NAMECHEAP:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">            
            Applications don't run locally only (I wish they would). They need to be distributed to the world via the world wide web. These tools help me expose my 
            creations to the world. Depending on the scale of the project, I use either Heroku (small projects), DigitalOcean (medium-sized projects)
            and Amazon Web Services (large-scale projects) to host my apps. Oh, I love NameCheap for domain hosting - they've got an awesome customer service.

            FIGMA:
        </h2>
        <p class="my-3">
            Figma helps me bring ideas to reality at the speed of light. I love its simplicity and the fact that I don't have to install nada just to use it.
            It has an awesome interface that helps me create awesome interfaces - that's meta.

            Love it or hate it, the web wouldn't exists without interactivity. Applications would have been stale and document-like like we had it in web 1.0.
            JavaScript brings life to apps by making them interactive and fun to work with.

        <p class="my-3">            
            While JavaScript brings interactive, it takes far more work to connect a client to a server in an optimized way.
            This is where these tools come in. These tools help me build frontend clients that connect with backend services
            and make my apps a perfect symphony.

            The tools above also have to be hosted somewhere. Well, the guys at Netlify are awesome. They make it way to simple to connect my local
            frontend client to the web making it accessible to the world in an automated manner. Thanks Netlify!
